# Movie Recommendation System (MRS-Web)

Welcome! This project is a friendly, full-stack web app that helps you discover movies you’ll love, using smart content-based recommendations. It’s built with Flask, styled with TailwindCSS, and designed to be both powerful and easy to use—whether you’re a movie buff, a developer, or just curious.

## What Makes This Special?

- **Personalized Movie Picks:** Get recommendations based on what you like, powered by the MovieLens 100k dataset.
- **Modern Web Experience:** Enjoy a clean, responsive interface thanks to TailwindCSS and Flask’s modular design.
- **Easy Setup & Automation:** One command sets up everything, and you can scaffold new features with a simple CLI.
- **Safe & Secure:** Your environment is protected with `.env` secrets and CSRF security.
- **Flexible Templates:** Quickly build and customize new pages or components.

## Getting Started (It’s Easy!)

1. **Set Up Python**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv my
    source my/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Initialize the Project**

    ```bash
    python app.py setup
    ```

3. **Start the App**

    ```bash
    python app.py runserver
    ```

4. **See It in Action**

    Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## How to Use the Web App

- Search for any movie you like.
- Click on any movie card to instantly get recommendations for similar movies—every card is interactive!
- Explore, discover, and enjoy new films tailored to your taste.

## Explore with the Command-Line Notebook

Want to get hands-on with the data and algorithms? Check out the `CLi-recommender.ipynb` Jupyter notebook! It’s a fun, interactive way to:

- **Explore the Data:** Load, clean, and visualize the MovieLens dataset step by step.
- **Get Custom Recommendations:** Type in any movie name and see what pops up—even if you misspell it, the notebook will help you find close matches.
- **Visualize Trends:** Instantly plot ratings, genres, and more with built-in charts.
- **See How It Works:** All the recommendation logic is right there in Python—tweak it, break it, or improve it!
- **Experiment Freely:** Add your own code, try new ideas, or just play around.

### How to Use the Notebook

1. **Open `CLi-recommender.ipynb`** in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code.
2. **Run the First Cell** to install all the Python packages you’ll need.
3. **Go Through Each Cell in Order** for a guided experience, from data loading to recommendations.
4. **Interact When Prompted:** Enter a movie name and see recommendations. If your movie isn’t found, you’ll get helpful suggestions.
5. **Make It Your Own:** Edit code, add new cells, or change parameters to explore further.

### Why Try the Notebook?

- **No Web UI Needed:** Perfect for those who love working in code or want to learn how everything works under the hood.
- **Great for Learning:** Every step is explained, so you’ll pick up new skills as you go.
- **Super Flexible:** Experiment, visualize, and analyze—all without touching the main app.

> Give the notebook a try for a deeper, more interactive dive into movie recommendations!
